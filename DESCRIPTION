Description: Considering high-dimensional sparse regression with measurement error in variables, 
    we assume the errors are Normally distributed with mean 0 and errors for each variable have a 
    specific variance. For such problem setting, function 'lsum' in this package can conduct 
    variable selection tasks. It works under EM framework, where the unknown true design matrix and 
    spike-slab prior indicators of regression parameters are treated as latent variables. The final output 
    coefficients are obtained following a decreasing sequence of spike parameters and the paths can be 
    displayed by calling functions in 'LS3MU' package.
